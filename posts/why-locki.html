  <section class="post-content"><p>We took lessons learned from translation tech industry and solved 3 primary localization challenges. Driven by our mission: Translate everything on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last Summer in San Francisco was not the coldest our CEO and Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryo-chikazawa-01533749/en">Ryo Chikizawa</a> has experienced, but it was definitely the most memorable he will ever recall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a web developer with rich previous experience in a large tech corporation DeNA, as well as the global video streaming startup Viki (which was sold to Rakuten in 2013), Ryo spent an immense amount of time learning about newest best software needed for his daily job. Starting his career in Japan, he spent hours reading Japanese and English tech documentation, a necessary step that could be simplified, if the right tools were in place.</p>

<p>Already at that time he was seeking a solution that would accelerate his learning and save time for executable adventures. And as he joined Viki, Ryo was responsible for creating and managing a crowd-sourcing subtitling translation tool. Spending a vast amount of time tackling the challenges of instant translations and engaging with the community, one thing led to another, and moving to San Francisco made him realize it’s now or never: Time to make a change!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He decided to take everything he learned and create something he always wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/ggbirds.jpg" alt="San Francisco birds" /></p>

<p>Multilingual tech background combined with Viki experience led to basic conclusions:</p>

<h3 id="3-translation-lessons-learned">3 translation lessons learned</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As the world gets ‘smaller’, the nuances of languages get bigger</li>
  <li>There’s an abundance of translation tools, but finding an optimal one is a challenge</li>
  <li>People love quick and easy fixes, but they also value being the part of the solution. Community translation provides added value to all parties involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is especially valid for tech documentation. As people choose their software, they jointly create a social group. The product adheres to their needs and wishes, and along the way, the community creates an individual identity and content. With that, terminology gains new semantic levels, and for those who are unfamiliar with the topic, meanings get lost in translation easily. Keeping up-to-date in a rapidly changing tech environment is tough, yet necessary.</p>

<p>Community plays a huge role in providing the latest and gratest updates. Collaborative translation allows all team members (product managers, lead engineers, marketing specialists and even product users) to edit and contribute, assuring the highest content accuracy. Whenever a dev team comes up with a new feature, anyone within the community should have an ability to update the documentation immediately and bring it to the large worldwide audience.</p>

<p>In an industry needs a lot of attention to comprehend it’s own, dealing with language barriers isn’t accommodating. Native English speakers can grasp many concepts faster due to their language privilege, but sometimes they run into a complete barrier trying to access quality software created far away from their home countries.</p>

<p>One thing is certain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We could instantly achieve tech excellence, if its content was comprehensive to all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="3-translation-challenges-solved">3 translation challenges solved</h3>

<p>Scratching own itch, <a href="https://locki.io/">Locki</a> was created with 3 primary goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a tool that can translate EVERYTHING on the internet instantly</li>
  <li>Enable EVERYONE to translate and edit online content in real-time</li>
  <li>Make it simpler, faster, more efficient than ANYTHING available so far</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, enable easiest updates whenever online content changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="vision-translate-everything-on-the-internet">Vision: Translate everything on the internet</h3>

<p>The reason why we decided to translate everything on the internet was simply factual. As expected, English is dominating the internet, with more than half of all websites providing content in it. Other languages are under-represented, with mainly less than 5% share of the online content:</p>

<p><img src="/img/content_languages_for_webistes.png" alt="Content languages for websites" /></p>

<p>However, merely a quarter of internet users set English as their preferred language:</p>

<p><img src="/img/internet_users_by_language.png" alt="Internet users by language" /></p>

<p>There is clearly a big gap between the provided and desired online languages, and who wouldn’t want to bridge it, if localization was simple?! We believe we can and should help worldwide internet users access relevant content in their desired language.</p>

<p>Our mission is making technology understanding faster, better and easier for any tech enthusiast in the world, while promoting collaboration and scalable development.</p>

<p>Everyone should be able to dive straight into new development concepts, regardless their educational and cultural background.</p>

<h3 id="thats-why-locki-is-here">That’s why <a href="https://locki.io/">Locki</a> is here</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>To localize your online content. And all its updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://locki.io/">Locki</a> is still in Beta. While we’re working on bringing the best solution for your online content, feel free to <a href="https://locki.io/signup">use it for free</a> and <a href="mailto:info@locki.io">give us your feedback</a>.</p>
